# SabotageLimiter

SabotageLimiter is a mod that allows the host to control how many critical sabotages each impostor can do per game and if they can sabotage while dead. 
Configuration can be found in ```Bepinex/Config/com.sabotagelimiter.whichtwix.cfg``` after opening the game once with the mod. 
You may edit the values inside, save the file, and click the f5 key wiith the game open to change the settings, or just save the file with the game closed. Setting changes will not take affect in a current ongoing game.
